**Question #1:** Do you know your credit score?  
**Question #2:** Do you know how to monitor your credit score, for free?  
**Question #3:** Do you know how to improve your credit score?  
**Question #4:** Do you know why your credit score matters?  

If you answered “yes” to all of the above, skip this article. If you missed one to all, please skim. Your wallet will thank you.

Your credit score is how banks and strangers judge your financial fitness. Anyone from a credit card company to a landlord to a prospective spouse may want to know your score. They want to determine your ability to repay debt. You want your score to be really, really good. When you apply for a car loan or a mortgage, you will get a lower interest rate the higher your score. Think of it as walking into a store: prices for identical items differ from person to person. A person with a 780 score gets to buy the shirt for $20. The person with the 520 credit score has to pay $70.

Credit scores range from 300 to 850, however the [exact scoring methodology](http://www.doughroller.net/credit/a-rare-glimpse-inside-the-fico-credit-score-formula/) is proprietary. Where does your score fall, and what does that mean?

**800+:** Insanely good. Make this your reach goal, but don’t stress it. I have perfect payment history but don’t fall in this bucket, due to the “young” age of my various credit accounts and the fact that I am not making a house or car payment.  

**740 - 800:** You are rockin’ it. You should be able to access the widest variety of debt products and lowest interest rates with a score in this range. You’ve never been late on a payment, and you don’t overuse your credit lines.

**680 - 740:** Not a bad starting place, but you will likely be approved for higher interest rate debt than your peers with better scores (think: larger monthly payments).  

**600 - 680:** The word here might be “mehhh”. Not good, but not terrible. You probably have a couple blemishes on your credit report. Either, too many inquiries and/or a late payment here and there. You might be maxing out some of your credit cards. You will want to try and clean up your credit act. With this score, some types of credit are no longer available to you, such as a home equity line of credit (a second mortgage on your house). You will definitely be paying a premium to access debt.  

**500 - 600:** This is not a zone you want to be in. This is widely considered to be “bad credit.” You will have much fewer debt options, and all the options will be super expensive.  

**Sub 500:** Get the heck out of here as quickly as possible. You likely want to speak to a credit counselor to figure out ways to improve your score quickly.
